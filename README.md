<h1>Bowen Military Band</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
My project is about promoting Bowen Military Band. The website features faeatures the different sections in the band, some of the performances done by the band, and lastly the band's social media pages. The webpage aims to draw in fans and potential fans to learn about the hisstory of the band, get to know the band members so to to expand the fanbase of the band.

<h2>Design Process</h2>
As a fan or potential fan, I who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

</h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>

Slideshow of Images - I can possibly add a slideshow of pictures taken during the band's various performances.

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<h3>Google font:-</h3>
<li>https://fonts.gstatic.com<li>
<li>https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans+Condensed:wght@300&family=Satisfy&display=swap</li>
<h3>Social Media Icons</h3>
<li>https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css</li>

<h2>Testing</h2>
<li>Navigation Tab:
-Go to navigation tab
-Click on section to view
-page automatically navigates down to the section user wants to view.</li>
<li>Contact form:
-Go to the "Contact Us" page
-Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
-Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
-Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
-The success message appears although form is not filled, however there'll be an error message as the field form has to be filled, this was because i applied "on-click" to the submit button.</li>
<li>Social Media Webpage:
-Try clicking on the various social media icons
-Social media page opens up in a new tab so that user can view the social media pages without losing the original webpage.</li>
<li>Responsive Layout:
-The responsive layout transition is not as smooth as what i expected it to be: transition between different screen sizes using the inspect tool on chrome.</li>

<h2>Media</h2>
<li>Some of the photos used in this site were obtained from Bowen Military Band's instagram pages.</li>
<li>Some were from my own gallery as I was part of the publicity department in Bowen Military Band where my role was to take pictures of the band and update the social media pages to promote the band.</li>

<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
I received inspiration for this project from myself, I was a member of the bowen military band and i thought it would be interesting to create a webpage to promote the band since i was given the role to promote the band before.
