Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.

>My project is about promoting Bowen Military Band. The website features faeatures the different sections in the band, some of the performances done by the band, and lastly the band's social media pages

Design Process
Provide us insights about your design process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory) Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.

>As a fan or potential fan, I who wish to learn more about the band's history and the band members, and possibly book them for shows.

Features

Existing Features

...
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

>Navigating bar - allows visitors of the webpage to navigate around the webpage.
>Form - allows fans/possible fans to enquire their doubts by submitting their name, email and questions in the form. They can try and book a show through the form as well.
>Youtube Video - allows fans/visitors to play the video on the webpage to view 1 of the band's performance.
>Social media icons - Allows fans/visitors to click on the social media icons to visit the various social media pages of the band.

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea

>Slideshow of Images - I can possibly add a slideshow of pictures taken during the band's various performances.

Technologies Used

Testing
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
