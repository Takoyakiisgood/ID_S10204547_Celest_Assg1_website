Overview
<li>My project is about promoting Bowen Military Band. The website features faeatures the different sections in the band, some of the performances done by the band, and lastly the band's social media pages.

-Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

<li>Some of the photos used in this site were obtained from Bowen Military Band's instagram pages.</li>

Acknowledgements
